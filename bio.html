            <h3>Overcoming Life's Pain</h3>

            <p>Born on Februray 25,1991, Aline Virtue Jean was raised as an only child and was considered to be the
              black sheep of her family.</p>

            <p>Being darkskinned and overweight didnt help with the critisim she faced growing up. Hitting her lowest
              point in life she contemplates over the desicion to end her life once and for all. As she lies in the tub
              she feels a sweet presence bringing peace to her soul and giving her comfort as well as LOVE.</p>
            <p> This unexpalinable experience left her speechless. She began to sobb uncontrollably and cried out to God. His spirit then embraces her and,
              leds her to read a scripture about the love of God and being fearfully and wonderfully made.</p>
            <p>This experience is a personal testimony that she chooses to share, hoping to bring life and encouragement to
              someone who is battling with depression and hopelessness.

            <h3>New found Love For Saving Lives</h3>

            <img src="me-health.jpg" alt="Ms. Virtue at work" class="health" />

            <p>As a child Ms. Jean remebers her premature little brother being in a box with so many tubes on him.
              Something seemed so sad and unsettling to her 5 year old soul. Suddenly it happened; He was gone. Her
              little brother was no longer with us.</p>
            <p> But the Registed Respiratory Therapist at the hospital were so
              amazing; full of peace, knowledge, love, and comfort. She knew she had to be a part of the team that not
              only works hard to save lives, but a team that makes sure they are truly making a difference in their
              patient's lives.</p>
            <p>She succesfully graduates and is prepared to start her journey in the world of medicine.</p>
