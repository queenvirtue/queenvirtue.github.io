            <h3>Killing Insecurities Through Fashion</h3>

            <p>Having been a victom of body shaming for years (which lead to depression and suicidal thoughts), she finally makes the decision to no longer be a VICTIM to body shameing and bullying but VICTORIOUS over all the negativity of those clouded with ignorance, through the word of Jesus Christ. She believes who God says she is. And it is reflected through her attire and walks of life. She is upappologitically bold in her fasion and longed to not only encourage and uplift women about who they are; however she wanted to "show" that they can be flawless inside and out.</p>

            <h3>The Birth Of Va'Tore Magazine</h3>

            <p>Who says a plus size women can't look amazing? Who says a slim woman can't wear this top or dress? ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We are all gorgeous and have the right to be confident no matter our shape or size. But the question remains: How can she "show" and demonstrate this to women? Then God spoke to her and gave her the crative idea of starting her Christian Fashion Foward magazine line that caters to women of all shapes and sizes. She names it Va'Toure Magazine!</p>
