            <h3>Killing Insecurities Through Fashion</h3>

            <p>Having been a victom of body shaming for years (which lead to depression and suicidal thoughts), she
              finally makes the decision to no longer be a VICTIM of body shameing and bullying but VICTORIOUS over
              all the negativity of those clouded with ignorance, through the word of Jesus Christ. She believes who
              God says she is. And it is reflected through her attire and walks of life.</p>
            <p>She is unapologetically bold in her fasion and longed to not only encourage and uplift women
              about who they are; however she wanted to "show" that they can be flawless inside and out.</p>
            <p>So many young women and teens believe that the only way to be fashion forward is to be very sexual
              and explicit with their attire. She wanted to challenge that way of thinking, by proving that an individual can
              be flawless, fashionable and yet keep one's dignity as well as one's class.</p>
              <p>She hopes to use her fashion forward skills as a means of a movement to show society that we can
                be different and are not boxed in by what the media says we should wear or how we should look.</p>

            <h3>The Birth Of Va'Tore Magazine</h3>

            <p>Who says a plus size women can't look amazing? Who says a slim woman can't wear this top or dress?
              ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We are all gorgeous and have the right to be confident no matter our shape or size.
              But the question remains: How can she "show" and demonstrate this to women? Then God spoke to her and
              gave her the crative idea of starting her Christian Fashion Foward magazine line that caters to women
              of all shapes and sizes. She names it Va'Toure Magazine!</p>
            <p>She imagines that this magazine will be one of the top fashion foward magazine around the world.
              Bigger than vogue, essence or teen magazine. She has quite the imagination. A regular city girl from the
              streets of little Haiti (a small town located in Miami, Fl) with no conncetions; all she had was only a big imagination. But she believes in another scripture
              that states that God can do "exceedingly", "abundantly", "above" ALL she can think, imagine or ask for.
              That means not even the sky is the limit. If she can think or imagine it; then God can do greater than that,
              so God for-bid she doesnt do what seems impossible....and make it POSSIBLE!</p>
