         <h2>Artist By Day and Hero By night</h2>
         <p>Performing has been a passion for virtue. Singing in church since the age of 5, Virtue finds life and joy
           in the love of music. Her love for music grows dramitically in her mid 20's and is now faced with the truth
           that God may be calling her to persue her dreams as an artist. She records and writes songs that are uplifting
           and encouraging while keeping a catchy tune. She manages to work and save lives from 7pm-7am and after work
           on Sun mornings she gets prepared to get on that alter at church to sing her soul out for the lover ofher
           soul, Jesus Christ.</p>
