         <h2>Artist By Day and Hero By night</h2>
         <p>Performing has been a passion for Virtue. Singing in church since the age of 5, Virtue finds life and joy
           in the love of music. Her love for music grows dramitically in her mid 20's and she is now faced with the truth
           that God may be calling her to persue her dreams as an artist.</p>

           <img src="artist-singer.jpg" alt="singer" />
         <p>She records and writes songs that are uplifting and encouraging while keeping a catchy tune to her music. She manages to work and save lives from 7pm-7am and after work
           on Sun mornings, she gets prepared to get on that alter at church to sing her soul out for the lover of her
           soul, Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>Many may ask how in the world is she able to do that and cope with such demanding schedule? Or how can she even function after coming from such a long shift, let alone a graveyard shift
            that is so demading physically and emotionally?</p>

          <p> The answer to that is simple; PASSION! When one is has a passion for something and is determined to release that passion, they are willing to make the nessesary sacrafices thats needed in order to succeed.</p>
          <p>When she's on the stage theres a new fire bomb of strength that falls over her, filling her entire body.
            One can compare the feeling to an adrenaline rush. No words can express the feeling of singing and doing what you feel like
            you were called to do. She lives, breathes, and believes her sole purpose of exsistance is to sing and worship her Heavenly Father. Its the very least she can give him in return for all
            He has done for her.</p>

           <h2>Turning a Passion Into a Career</h2>

             <p>"New Elevation Here As In Heaven" by Queen Virtue</p>
           </div>
          <P>When attempting to accomplish a goal, one must start with minor steps. She thought to her self, "surely this can become a small business of singing."
            Just as a plumber provides a service and recieve a wage or a hairstylest provides service of skills and recieves a wage, she can do the same for her music.
            After she is finished recording her EP project called "The Royalty Project" (a project that focuses on encouraging woman all over the world,
            reminding them that they are God's children and are of royalty.) she performs her songs in different venues and occassions; from parties to weddings and funerals.</p>

          <p>She always had a mind of a business woman. The music industry is a buisnes so she starts her future career of becoming a full time artist by taking baby steps and a leap of faith.
            Doing what she was destined to do as a career would be one of the biggest blessing that she could ever ask for. So many people never get the opprtunity
            or drive and will to do what they believe or dreamed of ever doing.</p>
          <p>She eventually wants to encourage people that no matter where you come from, or who you are; always rember "whose" you are....a child of God. One whom can do all things through Chirst Jesus;
            for nothing is impossibel for those who put thier hope in Jesus. </p>
